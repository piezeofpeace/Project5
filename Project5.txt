Project 5 Initial IDEA

So im going to be creating a code which will determine whetever a student 
can graduate or not,is gonna take in count
 gpa, grades, credits (like necessary credits fro graduation), 
and a different Identification for each student (ID)
I would like to use "Random class" whch randomly generates; 
credits and grades (so i dont have to put them manually and there will be some more variaty) 
(learned this in a extracurricular class with my brother 
and found it very interesting)
